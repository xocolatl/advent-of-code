This is my attempt to solve the Advent Of Code puzzles using PostgreSQL 10. I
don't plan to use any extensions except for what comes in contrib. I'm also
going to try to avoid using plpgsql (and certainly any other pl).

The goal is to challenge my SQL skills, and also showcase what can be done in
this language.

Comments and corrections welcome.
