This is my attempt to solve the [Advent Of Code 2018](http://adventofcode.com/2018)
puzzles using [PostgreSQL 11](https://www.postgresql.org/). I don't plan to use
any extensions except for what comes in contrib. I'm also going to try to avoid
using plpgsql (and certainly any other pl).

The goal is to challenge my SQL skills, and also showcase what can be done in
this language.

**Comments and improvements welcome.**

If you would like to run these yourself, save your input to a file called
`input.dat` in the directory for the appropriate day and run `psql -Xqf script.sql`.
