This is my attempt to solve the [Advent Of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017)
puzzles using [PostgreSQL 10](https://www.postgresql.org/). I don't plan to use
any extensions except for what comes in contrib. I'm also going to try to avoid
using plpgsql (and certainly any other pl).

The goal is to challenge my SQL skills, and also showcase what can be done in
this language.

**Comments and corrections welcome.**

If you would like to run these yourself, save your input to a file called
`input.txt` in the directory for the appropriate day (making sure there are no
blank lines at the end) and run `psql -f script.sql`.
