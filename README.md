This is my attempt to solve the [Advent Of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)
puzzles using [PostgreSQL 15](https://www.postgresql.org/). I don't plan to use
any extensions except for what comes in contrib. I'm also going to try to avoid
using plpgsql (and certainly any other pl).

The goal is to challenge my SQL skills, and also showcase what can be done in this
language.

**Comments and improvements welcome.**

If you would like to run these yourself, save your data in the appropriate `.input`
file, then run `psql -Xqf 2022/decXX.sql`.
